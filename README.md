#This application was developed as a take home project for Insight Engines.
#It is a CRUD application developed to see if a query is properly formatted to extract data from a search on Insight Engines Platform or not.
#If a query is improperly formatted or it will return invalid results, the fields will be marked with red.
#If a query is valid, the fields will be marked in green.
#The site also has some mobile responsiveness developed within it.
